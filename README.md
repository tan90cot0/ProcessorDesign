# ProcessorDesign
An 8-stage Assignment to build a single/multi-cycle processor written in VHDL. (The latter parts of the project were compiled using GHDL)

This was a part of my COL216 Assignment 2, which I did in my 4th semester at IIT Delhi. If you have any doubts, or need any assistance in understanding the codes or the detailed reports I've made, feel free to contact me:)
